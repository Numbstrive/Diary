hi lynn,i decided to show you a bit of my diary, so you can understand, this isnt me asking for empathy or anything,i just want you to know the full story..

I was always disappointed in myself, there was alot of things I didn't like about myself, I was selfish, ungrateful and greedy, I used my past traumatic experiences as an excuse to get empathy from others, and I was aware of this, I never really liked doing this sort of stuff, but bad habits die hard, how many times have we broken up, Lynn? 
the fact it's countless puts me to shame, it always ended because of me, because I was never grateful for things, I was always unhappy, everytime I assumed you ignored me or was upset at me I always ended up being wrong, your situation wasn't any better, I should've known this, we've been together for so long, I was always lashing out at you for making mistakes but I was never any better, my love was conditional, I guilt tripped you everytime I wanted something, and I'm sorry, because you always ended up giving me what I wanted, yet I was never grateful, there was so many things wrong with me, I was always so cold, always acted so rudely and never really gave you the love or affection you deserved, you never really did anything bad, this breakup wasn't because I was uncomfortable or anything, it was because im tired,we never got along well because of me,i was always so selfish, i didnt appreciate you enough,after what just happenend(sorry for the typos,these scripting apps disable autocorret)
i knew i was too much for you to handle,im the reason why you had mental issuses,all you ever did was try and care for me and love me,i didnt repay you for that,i would always write in diaries because,well..i dont have anyone to talk to, i dont want to get back together,not because i dont want to,but because i dont want to hurt you anymore,ive basically used you and abused you,and i dont want to do that anymore,i remember most of our moments,those times in cw where we fought aganist others together,when we used to play games like the mimic,or lights out with vc,i liked those moments,they gave me a purpose,the will to keep living,i always thought to myself "if this is what being alive felt like then i dont mind it at all" you were always there for me,i just got angry whenever you werent....heres another piece of my diary if it helps "5/27/2025 1:15Am Tuesday.


It's me, vil, or Leo, it's been awhile, a shit ton has happened, I'm single again, and things aren't working out well, let's see, remember Lynn?
Ever since she cheated on me, I've never trusted her, no matter how hard I tried, so one night I decided to break up with her, I was so tired of having to worry, I lost the one person who filled my heart, I'm alone now and empty, I only have one friend now who I'm not even sure if she likes me, you know I'm the type to feed off attention, it's been hell trying to forget about Lynn, I check her messages sometimes to see if she's safe, it's so hard to do this, I really miss our moments together, I wanted to marry her, but things didn't go well, eventually we broke up, she's doing bad in life which all the worse makes me feel even bad, she's been thinking about suicide ever since our break up, I'm not sure if I'll get back with her, but I personally think it's better this way, I was never a good boyfriend, but if I was, I would be a ruined version of it, I should've stayed alone, being social and finally dating someone after Liv ruined me, being alone is slowly driving me nuts and the only thing that's helping is my new friend sleepy, she comforted me when I vented,other then that she's been really helpful, been able to get through this thanks to her, I'm still having trouble with comprehending this, it doesn't feel real or right, and it hurts me so bad, I wanna cry because I don't want to lose Lynn, but it's already been done.. "
it was long ago but its like its happening again,all the times ive been so harsh and cold was to push you away, i lied about those things,i was only butthurt because im spoiled,i forgot what it means to truely love someone, i dont want to stay with someone when i know all i ever do is just hurt them,youve gone through alot,you deserve someone better,i was never a good guy,im horrible,i really missed the good times,im gonna go back to being isolated,i dont have you now,and i dont want to be social or find another girl,if anything,this world can burn to hell for all i care...i will never find someone like you,and i dont want to,i only want you because you and i had great times,youve made me happy,gave me reasons to live,no other girl did that, seriously,youve been so helpful and kind,what did i do to get someone like you..i was blessed,but i didnt value you properly,thats my fault,so without me,youll be better off,and honestly,if you moved on and got someone else,id cry and probably be depressed forever,but its not my decesion,i just want you to be happy,i really do,







so basically, i am sorry,for putting you through so much pain, i hope you can forgive me,and forget i ever existed,stay safe and take care,i love you.
